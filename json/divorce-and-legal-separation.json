Each divorce and legal separation is different, but understanding how the process works can help bridge gaps and keep the focus on what's most important.</p><p>Laws vary by state, but legal separation is often the first step. Legal separation usually involves filing a Marriage Separation Agreement with the court to outline the terms of your separation. It's a temporary arrangement that protects each spouse and determines basic rights and responsibilities until divorce proceedings are finalized.</p><p>After legal separation, divorce is the formal termination of your relationship. Divorce is easiest when you and your spouse can agree on the conditions. Filling out a Divorce Worksheet is a good way to understand everything involved and see whether you're on the same page.

If there are issues that keep you from reaching an agreement, it's a good idea to consider mediation or finding a lawyer.</p><p>There are also special steps to take if you don't know where your spouse is.</p><p>Following legal separation and divorce, ongoing child custody and credit issues may pop up.
